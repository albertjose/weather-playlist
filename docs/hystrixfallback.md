# Hystrix (Netflix OSS / Spring Cloud)
I used the Hystrix, a circuit breaker implementaion, to made this API more resilient and fault tolerant. I use Hystrix with Feign to implement fallbacks to external request in Spotify and OpenWeatherMaps, by default a request try to find results in cache ([more info](docs/cache.md)), with no results, the clients (Feign) will be called, in real scenario not everything is perfect, clients can takes long times to response, or return multiples errors, the resources can stay saturated, the hystrix take action, the fallback return the default value prevent cascading failure and enable resilience, allowing the application to recover from possible catastrophic scenarios.
